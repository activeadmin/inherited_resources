* Backwards incompatible: by default, Inherited Resources respond only :html requests
* Added a quick way to overwrite the redirect to url in :create, :update and :destroy

# Version 0.5.2

* Decoupled routes name from :instance_name and :collection_name. This way we
  have more flexibility. Use route_instance_name and route_collection_name to
  to change routes.
* Avoid calling human_name on nil when a resource class is not defined.
* Only call I18n if it's defined.

# Version 0.4.6-0

* Dealing with namespaced controllers out of the box.
* Added support to namespaced routes through :route_prefix.
* Added fix when resource_url is not defined.
* Added better handling for namespaced controllers.
* Added flash messages scoped by namespaced controllers.
* Deprecated {{resource}} in I18n, use {{resource_name}} instead.
* rspec bug fix is not automatically required anymore. User has to do it
  explicitly.
* Added a file which fix a rspec bug when render is called inside a method
  which receives a block.
* parent? does not take begin_of_association_chain into account anymore
* Added options to url helpers.
* Added :optional to belongs_to associations. It allows you to deal with
  categories/1/products/2 and /products/2 with just one controller.
* Cleaned up tests.

# Version 0.3.0

* Minor bump after three bug fixes.
* Bug fix when showing warning of constant redefinition.
* Bug fix with ApplicationController not being unloaded properly on development.

  raise "NoMethodError _url", not it will call root_url.

controllers, belongs_to, nested_belongs_to and url helpers.
